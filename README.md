## Final Year Project

This repository showcases my work for my final year Computer Science project. The aim of the project was to classify individual videos from a dataset as either reversed or not reversed using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The final product was highly successful and classified videos correctly over 96% of the time.

This repository contains evidence of:

• A high proficiency using the Python programming language

• Understanding and implementation of cutting-edge computer vision technologies, including multi-object detection, object tracking, optical flow, and pose estimation.

• Experience and understanding of how to collect and identify relevant training data to train a neural network classifier using Pytorch, as well as understanding how to preprocess the data and evaluate the success of the classification model. 

• A high level of written communication skills, with a well-documented, thorough and detailed project report which demonstrates my logical and analytical process to achieve the project's aims.
